# Whiteboard

This is a pretty basic whiteboard with simple tools as pencil, eraser. Operations which you can perform as of now are drawing, erasing, changing the pen colour and size, changing the theme,  and scrolling.

This is a responsive website. The sidebars take minimal space so as to provide as much space as possible so that you can utilize every bit of the screen. 

Here is a small preview of how it works. There is a lot of scope for improvement. We’ll be working on that.
